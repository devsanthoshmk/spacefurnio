The first section on the / homepage has poor responsive layout. Fix that section so it works correctly on all screen sizes with the following requirements:

Requirements

Desktop / Large Screens:

Left side: hero image, fully visible with no cropping (maintain aspect ratio).

Right side: “New Arrivals” products displayed in a rectangular block, showing 3–4 product images.

Product images must maintain consistent aspect ratio (no stretching).

Each product image links to the shopping page.

Include a “Grab it Now” button under the product images (on the right side).

Mobile / Small Screens:

New Arrivals block should move below the hero image.

The “Grab it Now” button should appear after the product images (not under those images).

Global Rules

The entire section must fit within the viewport (≤ 100vh and even in mobile devices where the lvh and svh vary) on all screen sizes.

No vertical scrolling should be required to view the full hero section.

Responsiveness should never distort or crop product images.

Use a browser preview of the / route to verify layout—do not scroll; adjust layout so the hero section fits without losing required elements.
